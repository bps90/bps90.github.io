### ERBIUM (ER) REST: UMA IMPLEMENTAÇÃO COAP NO CONTIKI-OS

Erbium (Er) is a low-power REST Engine for Contiki that was developed together with [SICS](http://www.sics.se/nes) (and a rare earth element that is found in the Ytterby mine near Stockholm). The REST Engine includes a comprehensive embedded CoAP implementation, which became the official one for the [Contiki OS](http://www.contiki-os.org/). It supports [RFC 7252](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7252) together with [blockwise transfers](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-block) and [observing](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-observe).

### SEMINÁRIO SOBRE 6LOWPAN

A LoWPAN is a simple low cost communication network that allows wireless connectivity in applications with limited power and relaxed throughput requirements. A LoWPAN typically includes devices that work together to connect the physical environment to real-world applications, e.g., wireless sensors. LoWPANs conform to the IEEE 802.15.4-2003 standard [IEEE802.15.4].

### THE CONSTRAINED APPLICATION PROTOCOL (COAP)

The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a specialized web transfer protocol for use with constrained nodes and constrained
(e.g., low-power, lossy) networks. The nodes often have 8-bit microcontrollers with small amounts of ROM and RAM, while constrained networks such as IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPANs) often have high packet error rates and a typical throughput of 10s of kbit/s. The protocol is designed for machine-to-machine (M2M) applications such as smart energy and building automation.

### UBUNTU CORE

Ubuntu Core, also known as Snappy, is a stripped down version of Ubuntu, designed to run securely on autonomous machines, devices and other internet-connected digital things. From homes to drones, these devices are set to revolutionise many aspects of our lives, but they need an operating system that is different from that of traditional PCs.
