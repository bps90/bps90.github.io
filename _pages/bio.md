<!--
My first experience as a research was there: from june 2009 to octuber 2012 I was among Junior researchs at [NBCGIB-UESC](http://nbcgib.uesc.br/nbcgib/), working on computational modeling, parallel processing (GPU and CPU). Then, I received a Bachelor degree at [Universidade Estadual de Santa Cruz - UESC](http://www.uesc.br) on November 2012.

I received Master degree at [DCC-UFMG](http://www.dcc.ufmg.br/dcc/) on March, 2015. The main research focus was wireless sensor networks protocols. My mentors were [Luiz F. M. Vieira](http://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~lfvieira/) and [Marcos A. M. Vieira](http://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~mmvieira/).

#### Personal

I'm originally from the *best city of the entire world (rsrs)* [**Jequi√©!!!**](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jequi%C3%A9). I like so much [**Salvador**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador,_Bahia) and [**Belo Horizonte**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belo_Horizonte) as well. Besides academic interests, I enjoy:

* [Bahiana Food](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culin%C3%A1ria_da_Bahia)
* Watch good movies and series!
* Keeping myself informed
* Travel and meet people
* Programming and related 
	+ Actually I'm have some skills for programming in R, C, CUDA, Java, Bash, Python, TinyOS (C-Like), little bit of Pearl, and others.
		- I've understood since 2013 that research requires statistical tools. So, I recommend learning at least one, ex: R.
	+ See [PEP 20 -- The Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/)
