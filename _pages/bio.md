#### Short Bio

My first experience as a research was there: from june 2009 to octuber 2012 I was among Junior researchs at [NBCGIB-UESC](http://nbcgib.uesc.br/nbcgib/), working on computational modeling, parallel processing (GPU and CPU). Then, I received a Bachelor degree at [Universidade Estadual de Santa Cruz - UESC](http://www.uesc.br) on November 2012.

I received Master degree at [DCC-UFMG](http://www.dcc.ufmg.br/dcc/) on March, 2015. The main research focus was wireless sensor networks protocols. My mentors were [Luiz F. M. Vieira](http://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~lfvieira/) and [Marcos A. M. Vieira](http://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~mmvieira/).

	+ Actually I'm have some skills for programming in R, C, CUDA, Java, Bash, Python, TinyOS (C-Like), little bit of Pearl.
		- From 2013 to nowadays I understand that research requires R.
