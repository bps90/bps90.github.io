## Teaching principles

**Question**: What are Bruno’s teaching principles?

**Answer**: A statement of my teaching principles can be found in the syllabus of every course I teach. Here’s a summary:

**Principle 1**: “Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler.”
I approach each topic as clearly as possible, but I do not avoid the intrinsic complexity of the topic. Be prepared for challenges!

[comment]: # **Principle 2**: Good learning = mastering the maths + interpreting the results.I want you to develop both mathematical and pragmatic abilities. Take advantage to improve what you need the most. 

**Principle 2**: Intelligence is not synonymous with good results: reading the basic bibliography is essential, doing homework is essential. Understanding what is said in a lecture does not automatically mean you will score well in the exams. Reading and practicing are essential, and irreplaceable.

**Principle 3**: At the beginning of the course you have all the opportunities to succeed in this course, your success will largely depend on your attitude. It is your own individual effort that turns opportunities into results.


## Grading

**Question**: I believe that a question in my exam was given an unfair grade. What should I do?

**Answer**: If you believe one or more questions in an exam were unfairly graded, please write a clear and concise justification of why you think this is the case. You must:

write your justification on the side of each corresponding question (say, questions 1a, 2, 4c) in the exam itself, add to top of the front page of the exam: “Please, review questions 1a, 2, and 4c”, and return the exam to me. I will analyze your request and respond in written in the exam itself.

Be aware that the **burden of proof is on you**: you have to convince me that your question is correct, and I do not have to convince you your question is wrong.

Here there are some examples of **invalid justifications**:

- “I think I answered the question correctly. What did I do wrong?”
- “I see nothing wrong in my answer. I deserve a full grad for it.”
- “Well, while I wrote ‘x’ as an answer, what I really meant was ‘y’. Wouldn’t you please consider what I meant instead of what I actually wrote?”
- “Can you please check what you can do to give me a higher grade on this question?”


[comment]: # **Question**: Why in true/false questions does each wrong answer cancel a right answer?

[comment]: # **Answer**: This rule is just a natural application of a field of study called decision theory (if you are interested in it, you can take my course on information theory, where we discuss the subject). Let me try to briefly explain here the rationale behind this rule.

[comment]: # Suppose that in an ordinary exam 50% of the true/false questions are true and 50% are false. An unprepared student who blindly guesses an answer for each question is expected to get 50% of the answers correctly (by simply, say, guessing all answers to be “true”). In case I don’t use the rule that a wrong answer cancels a right answer, such a student is expected to get 50% of the marks for this question, even if they know nothing about the subject of the exam!

[comment]: # Now suppose that I adopt the rule that every wrong answer cancels a correct answer. An unprepared student facing a question whose answer they don’t know still has to choose between leaving the answer blank or making a blind guess. If the question is left blank, the grade for the question will be 0 marks. If the student blindly guesses an answer, they will correctly get it with probability 50%. In case it is correct, they will get full marks for the question (say, N marks), and in case it’s wrong they will cancel the marks for another correctly answered question (which means they’ll lose N marks). Hence, the student’s expected grade in this case will be

[comment]: # 50% (N marks) + 50% (-N marks) = 0 marks.

[comment]: # You now can probably see why I adopt this rule. It discourages an unprepared student from blindly guessing, and brings the expected grade of such a student back to zero, since the expected gain of guessing and that of leaving the question blank is the same. On the other hand, a prepared student still has an incentive to answer the question, as their expected gain will be positive (but the derivation of this result is left for you as an exercise 😉 ).


## Missed exams and make-up (substitute) exam.

**Question**: I missed an exam. What should I do?

**Answer**: You can take the make-up (substitute) exam at the end of the semester.

**Question**: Who can take the make-up (substitute) exam?

**Answer**: Every student who missed any exam for any reason can take them make-up (substitute) exam at the end of the semester. **No justification is needed**.

As an act of grace, I may allow students who didn’t miss any exam to take the make-up (substitute) exam to try to improve their final grade in the course.

**Question**: How does the make-up (substitute) exam work?

**Answer**: The make-up (substitute) takes place at the end of the semester, and it covers all subjects seen during the whole semester. It does not matter which exam you missed or the exam’s grades you want to replace, all students will take the same make-up (substitute) exam at the same date.

But be aware: **if you take the make-up (substitute) exam, your grade will necessarily replace your lowest grade in exams in the semester.**

## Improving your final grade

**Question**: I did not miss any exam. Can I take the make-up (substitute) exam to try to improve my grade?

**Answer**: As an act of grace, I may allow students who didn’t miss any exam to take the substitute exam to try to improve their final grade in the course.

But be aware: **if you take the make-up (substitute) exam, your grade will necessarily replace your lowest grade in exams in the semester.**

**Question**: The semester is over and I need only 0.1 marks to pass the course. What can I do to get these 0.1 extra marks?

**Answer**: You have three options, in this order:

1. Take the make-up exam (substitute) exam and get a grade 0.1 marks higher than you had before.
2. Take the special exam and get a higher grade.
3. Build a time machine, go back in time, and do better during the semester.

Note that are **NOT** options listed above:

1. Have me give you 0.1 marks out of the blue.
2. Do all homework you haven’t done during the whole semester in hopes of getting marks for that.
3. Make some sort of special project to try to increase your grade.

**Question**: The semester is over and I need only 0.1 marks to get a grade I really want (e.g., change from concept B to A). What can I do to get these 0.1 extra marks?

**Answer**: See the answer to the previous question.

## Special exam

**Question**: Who can take the special exam at the end of the semester?

**Answer**: Any student can take the special exam at the end of the semester, independently of whether they passed or failed the course.

**Question**: If I take the special exam, how is it computed in my final grade?

**Answer**: This depends on whether you have taken the special exam whil not yet having passed the course, or while having already passed the course.

Let x be your original grade in the semester (before the special exam), y be your grade on the special exam, and z be your final grade resulting from the combination of your original grade and the special exam grade.

If you have not yet passed the course, your final grade is computed as z = (x+y)/2. Note that in case you had not originally passed the course, your grade in the special exam can decrease your final grade!

If you have already passed the course, your final grade is computed as z= max(x, (x+y)/2). Note that in case you had originally passed the course, your grade in the special exam cannot decrease your final grade (but only increase it).
