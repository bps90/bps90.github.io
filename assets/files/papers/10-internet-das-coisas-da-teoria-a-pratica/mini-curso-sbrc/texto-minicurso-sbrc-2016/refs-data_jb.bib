abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is a networking paradigm where interconnected, smart objects continuously generate data and transmit it over the Internet. Much of the IoT initiatives are geared towards manufacturing low-cost and energy-efficient hardware for these objects, as well as the communication technologies that provide objects interconnectivity. However, the solutions to manage and utilize the massive volume of data produced by these objects are yet to mature. Traditional database management solutions fall short in satisfying the sophisticated application needs of an IoT network that has a truly global-scale. Current solutions for IoT data management address partial aspects of the IoT environment with special focus on sensor networks. In this paper, we survey the data management solutions that are proposed for IoT or subsystems of the IoT. We highlight the distinctive design primitives that we believe should be addressed in an IoT data management solution, and discuss how they are approached by the proposed solutions. We finally propose a data management framework for IoT that takes into consideration the discussed design elements and acts as a seed to a comprehensive IoT data management solution. The framework we propose adapts a federated, data- and sources-centric approach to link the diverse Things with their abundance of data to the potential applications and services that are envisioned for IoT.},

@article{BorgesNeto2015,
abstract = {We are entering a new era of computing technology, the era of Internet of Things (IoT). An important element for this popularization is the large use of off-the-shelf sensors. Most of those sensors will be deployed by different owners, generally common users, creating what we call the Collaborative IoT. This collaborative IoT helps to increase considerably the amount and availability of collected data for different purposes, creating new interesting opportunities, but also several challenges. For example, it is very challenging to search for and select a desired sensor or a group of sensors when there is no description about the provided sensed data or when it is imprecise. Given that, in this work we characterize the properties of the sensed data in the Internet of Things, mainly the sensed data contributed by several sources, including sensors from common users. We conclude that, in order to safely use data available in the IoT, we need a filtering process to increase the data reliability. In this direction, we propose a new simple and powerful approach that helps to select reliable sensors. We tested our method for different types of sensed data, and the results reveal the effectiveness in the correct selection of sensor data.},

@article{Tsai2014,
abstract = {It sounds like mission impossible to connect everything on the Earth together via Internet, but Internet of Things (IoT) will dramatically change our life in the foreseeable future, by making many "impossibles" possible. To many, the massive data generated or captured by IoT are considered having highly useful and valuable information. Data mining will no doubt play a critical role in making this kind of system smart enough to provide more convenient services and environments. This paper begins with a discussion of the IoT. Then, a brief review of the features of "data from IoT" and "data mining for IoT' is given. Finally, changes, potentials, open issues, and future trends of this field are addressed.},

@article{Perera2014,
abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is part of the Internet of the future and will comprise billions of intelligent communicating “things” or Internet Connected Objects (ICOs) that will have sensing, actuating, and data processing capabilities. Each ICO will have one or more embedded sensors that will capture potentially enormous amounts of data. The sensors and related data streams can be clustered physically or virtually, which raises the challenge of searching and selecting the right sensors for a query in an efficient and effective way. This paper proposes a context-aware sensor search, selection, and ranking model, called CASSARAM, to address the challenge of efficiently selecting a subset of relevant sensors out of a large set of sensors with similar functionality and capabilities. CASSARAM considers user preferences and a broad range of sensor characteristics such as reliability, accuracy, location, battery life, and many more. This paper highlights the importance of sensor search, selection and ranking for the IoT, identifies important characteristics of both sensors and data capture processes, and discusses how semantic and quantitative reasoning can be combined together. This paper also addresses challenges such as efficient distributed sensor search and relational-expression based filtering. CASSARAM testing and performance evaluation results are presented and discussed. View full abstract},

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is an important part of the new generation information technology. Data management for IoT plays a crucial role in its effective operations and has become a key research topic of IoT. Much work has been done to enable effective and intelligent data processing and analysis when IoT is evolving from Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) and other related technologies. In this paper, we start from the core definition and architecture of IoT, aiming at examining current research effort to derive a holistic view of existing literatures. We present a layered reference model for IoT data management and elaborate the related research topics and solutions in each layer. Based on our analysis, we identify research challenges and opportunities for future work.},
