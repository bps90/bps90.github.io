\section{Complexity Analysis}\label{sec:analysis}

In this section we assume a synchronous communication
model with point-to-point message passing. In this model, all nodes start
executing the algorithm simultaneously, and time is divided into
synchronous rounds, i.e., when a message is sent from node $v$ to its neighbor
$u$ at time-slot $t$, it must arrive at $u$ before time-slot $t+1$.

We first analyze the message and time
complexity of the IPv6 address allocation phase of Matrix, and then
look into the message complexity of the control plane
of Matrix after the network initialization phase.

Note that Matrix requires that an underlying acyclic topology (Ctree) has
been constructed by the network before the address allocation starts, i.e.,
every node knows who its parent in the Ctree is. 
Moreover, one of the building blocks of Matrix is the IPv6 multihop host
configuration, performed by MHCL \cite{2016techreport}. 
%Therefore, we have that
%$Time(Matrix^{IP})$ = $Time(MHCL)$ and $Msg(Matrix^{IP})$ = $Msg(MHCL)$.
%The address allocation phase consists in (1) number of descendants aggregation,
%using a convergecast routine, in which leaf nodes start sending messages to
% their parents and parents aggregate the received information and forward it upwards
%until the root is reached; (2) the root broadcasts address allocation
%information downward along the tree $T$, each message being acknowledged. The
% time complexity of each phase is $depth(T)$ and the message complexity is $2(n-1)$.


\begin{theorem} \cite{2016techreport} For any network of size $n$ with a
spanning collection tree $Ctree$ rooted at node $root$, the message and time
complexity of Matrix protocol in the address allocation phase is 
$Msg(Matrix^{IP}(Ctree, root))$ = $O(n)$ and $Time(Matrix^{IP}$ $(T, root))$
= $O(depth(Ctree))$, respectively. This message and time complexity is
asymptotically optimal.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
The address allocation phase is comprised of a tree broadcast and a tree
convergecast.
In the broadcast operation, a message (with address allocation information) must be
sent to every node by the respective parent, which needs $\Omega(n)$ messages.
Moreover the message sent by the root must reach every node at distance
$depth(Ctree)$ hops away, which needs $\Omega(depth(Ctree))$ time-slots.
Similarly, in the convergecast operation, every node must send a message to its
parent after having received a message from its children, which needs
$\Omega(n)$ messages. Also, a message sent by every leaf node must reach the
root, at distance $\leq depth(Ctree)$, which needs $\Omega(depth(Ctree))$
time-slots.
\end{proof}


Next, we eximine the communication cost of the routines involved in the
alternative routing, performed in the presence of persistent node and link
failures.

%\begin{theorem} For any failure with a duration time $\Delta$, that originates
%$\mathcal{L_{CTP}}$ topology changes and an interval of $\delta$ between
%beacons, $Message(Matrix(\Delta,\delta,\mathcal{L_{CTP}} ))=
%O(\mathcal{L_{CTP}})$.\end{theorem}
%\begin{proof}
%When a failure occurs, a node that has its parent changed to an adoptive parent
% must send beacons every $\delta$ time. If this failure occurs by $\Delta$ time, that is, the node stays for $\Delta$ time with its current parent as its adoptive parent, then it sends $\frac{\Delta}{\delta}$ beacons. Since one failure can originate $\mathcal{L_{CTP}}$ changes, then the number of beacons sent is $\mathcal{L_{CTP}}\times\frac{\Delta}{\delta}$.
%\end{proof}

\begin{theorem} Consider a network with $n$ nodes and a failure event that
causes $\mathcal{L_{CT}}$ links to change in the collection tree Ctree for at
most $\Delta$ ms.
Moreover, consider a beacon interval of $\delta$ ms.
The control message complexity of Matrix to perform
alternative routing is $Msg(Matrix^{RC})$ = $O(n)$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Consider the $\mathcal{L_{CT}}$ link changes in the collection tree Ctree. Note
that $\mathcal{L_{CT}} = O(n)$, since Ctree is acyclic and, therefore, has at
most $n-1$ links.
Every link that was changed must be inserted in the RCtree table of the respective (new) parent
and kept during the interval $\Delta$ using regularly sent beacons from the
child to the parent. Given a beacon interval of $\delta$, the total number of
control messages is bounded by ${\Delta}/{\delta} \times \mathcal{L_{CT}} =
O(n)$.
\end{proof}

Note that, in reality, the assumptions of synchrony and point-to-point message
delivery do not hold in a 6LoWPAN. The moment in which each node joins the tree,
varies from node to node, such that nodes closer
to the root tend to start executing the address allocation protocol earlier than
nodes farther away from the root. Moreover, collisions and node and
link failures can cause delays and prevent messages from being delivered. We
analyze the performance of Matrix in an asynchronous model with collisions and
transient node and link failures of variable duration through simulations in
Section~\ref{sec:results}.
