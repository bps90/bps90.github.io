\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper we propose Matrix: a novel routing protocol that is built upon
a data collection structure and is comprised of two phases: (1) network
initialization, in which hierarchical IPv6
addresses, which reflect the topology of
the underlying wireless network, are assigned to nodes in a multihop way; and
(2) reliable any-to-any communication, which enables message and
memory-efficient implementation of a wide range of new applications
for 6LoWPAN.
