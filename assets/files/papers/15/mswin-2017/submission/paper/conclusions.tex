\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

In this work, we presented $\mu$Matrix: a memory efficient routing protocol for 6LoWPAN that performs any-to-any routing, hierarchical address allocation, and mobility management. As a building block of $\mu$Matrix, we proposed a passive mobility detection mechanism that captures topological changes without requiring additional hardware. Finally, we introduced the CRWP, a mobility model suited for scenarios with mobile nodes that have cyclical movement patterns. As future work, we plan to run experiments with physical devices and extend experimental evaluation to more mobile models, such as faulty communications scenarios.
